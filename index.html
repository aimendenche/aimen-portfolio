                            I believe we all carry a backpack from birth.<br>
                            Throughout life, we collect precious things from people we meet:<br>
                            Friendship, love, and yes, sometimes worries too.<br><br>
                            In the end, it's all these experiences that shape who we are today.<br><br>
                            Sharing moments with others Always helps us grow<br>
                            One way or another.
